# Model-Pruning
Goals:

The objective of this project is to prune a classic neural network model to reduce both model size and inference latency. The specific goals to achieve this are as follows:

- Understand the basic concept of pruning
- Implement and evaluate fine-grained pruning
- Implement and evaluate channel pruning
- Get a basic understanding of performance improvement (such as speedup) from pruning
- Understand the differences and tradeoffs between these pruning approaches
